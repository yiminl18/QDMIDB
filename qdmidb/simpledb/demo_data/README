ImputeDB currently only handles integer values. 

The datasets used for evaluation have both floating point numbers and strings.
For floating point, we multiplied by 100 and truncated. We multipled by 100 as various
columns have values between 0 and 1, so just truncating wouldn't work and we wanted
to treat all of these values in the same way.


Strings are only used in the fcc benchmark queries. In this case, we enumerated the strings
across all tables. We need enumerations to be consistent across tables to allow for joining
across fcc and gdp on countrycitizen. This does add a slight complication to imputing the
missing enumeration value for missing strings: enumerations are not necessarily contiguous
(e.g. A, B may not map to 1 and 2, in a given table). This shouldn't affect the
regression tree approach but will likely mess up simpler imputation models (like mean).
Since comparisons are against the same imputation algo on the base table, this shouldn't
be an issue for fair comparisons.

After running ../create_data.sh, the .dat files here can be moved where necessary (along
with the catalog.txt created and saved here as well).

Enumerations used are found in the enums.txt file.
